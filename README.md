Vim configurations

===

My configurations and extentions for GVim. GVim 7.4 is expected in these scripts.

2014/1/28 : Merge with changes on notebook, no indent for brackets inside namespace.
2014/7/23 : ; and , work great for fFtT command, no need of plug-in. No strong need for repeating other navigation.
2014/11/4 : Store plug ins under plugin folder of gVim, put ctags.exe in PATH.
